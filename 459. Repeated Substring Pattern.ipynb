    "# In the repeatedSubstringPattern method, the goal is to determine if the given string s can be constructed by repeating a substring. The solution uses an interesting approach based on string manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps in the logic:\n",
    "# Concatenating the string to itself (with modifications):\n",
    "\n",
    "# The method creates a new string s_fold, which is the concatenation of s without the first character (s[1:]) and s without the last character (s[:-1]).\n",
    "# Essentially, this creates a version of s that has its start and end parts removed and rejoined:\n",
    "# css\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# s_fold = s[1:] + s[:-1]\n",
    "# For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If s = \"abab\", then:\n",
    "# s[1:] = \"bab\"\n",
    "# s[:-1] = \"aba\"\n",
    "# So, s_fold = \"bababa\".\n",
    "# Checking if s is a substring of s_fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The key observation here is that if s can be constructed by repeating a substring, then the original string s should appear somewhere inside s_fold.\n",
    "# If s is a repeated substring, removing the first and last characters from s_fold breaks the symmetry only at the ends. Thus, any occurrence of s inside this larger folded string indicates that the original string has a repeated pattern.\n",
    "# Return the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If s is found within s_fold, it implies that s is made by repeating a substring, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n",
    "# Why does this work?\n",
    "# By removing the first and last character and then concatenating the modified parts, you're effectively breaking any single occurrence of s into parts but preserving multiple occurrences of a repeated substring within the larger structure. Hence, checking whether s is in s_fold allows detecting repeated patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "# For s = \"abab\":\n",
    "\n",
    "# s_fold = \"bababa\"\n",
    "# \"abab\" is found in \"bababa\", so the function returns True.\n",
    "# For s = \"abcabc\":\n",
    "\n",
    "# s_fold = \"bcabcab\"\n",
    "# \"abcabc\" is found in \"bcabcab\", so the function returns True.\n",
    "# For s = \"abcd\":\n",
    "\n",
    "# s_fold = \"bcda\"\n",
    "# \"abcd\" is not found in \"bcda\", so the function returns False."
